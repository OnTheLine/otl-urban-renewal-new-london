- In 2018, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act, the Center partnered with New London Landmarks to learn how urban renewal policies shaped New London’s neighborhoods. Our research uncovered a neighborhood lost to the Winthrop Cove Renewal Project; in a predominantly African-American neighborhood, almost 700 families were displaced, streets were abolished, and the housing was never rebuilt. That Fall, with funding from CT Humanities, we created a historic walking tour of the Winthrop Cove neighborhood, “Discrimination, Urban Renewal, and New London’s Lost Neighborhood”.
